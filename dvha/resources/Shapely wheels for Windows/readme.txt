Shapely is notoriously frustrating to install on Windows. Attached are wheels to make that
process much easier. Files were downloaded from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#shapely).

instead of typing:
pip install shapely

try the following from the directory the wheel is in:
pip install Shapely-1.6.4.post1-cp37-cp37m-win32.whl
    or
pip install Shapely-1.6.4.post1-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl
