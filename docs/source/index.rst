Welcome to the documentation for DVHA power-users!
==================================================

The documentation here is largely geared towards advanced uses of DVHA
involving custom scripts with python. Basic use of the graphical user
interface is documented in the user manual PDFs included with each
`release on GitHub <https://github.com/cutright/DVH-Analytics/releases>`__.
